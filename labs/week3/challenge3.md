# 305CDE Challenge 3

This challenge should be attempted after you have attended the second lab and worked through Worksheet 3 (_Functions and Objects Part 3_). You may need to attend other labs to fulfil some of the requirements.

## Guidelines

* Commit your solution to a new private project/repository in GitLab, and give it a sensible name: for example `305CDE Challenge 3`.
* Add the following members with _reporter_ permissions under `Settings > Members` for your project:
	- Mark Tyers `marktyers`
	- Jianhua Yang `jianhua`
	- Colin Stephen `c0lin`
* You are free to commit changes to your code to improve it further at any point up to the assessment submission deadline.
* You may not manage to satisfy all of the requirements, but you should aim to do so.
* Extended requirements may require knowledge from future lab sessions to complete.
* Marking will be based on how closely you meet the requirements, whether you attempt any of the extended requirements, and how maintainable your JS code is.

## Specification
