1. **Modelling**: you will see working code written by an expert which will allow you to understand the key concepts.
2. **Coaching**: you will use these concepts to carry out a number of structured activities under the guidance of experienced academics.
3. **Scaffolding**: you will learn the domain skills in a carefully determined sequence to maximise your subject understanding
