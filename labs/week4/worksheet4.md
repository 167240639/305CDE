# 305CDE Worksheet 4

## About

This week's lab tasks will focus on two important areas where JS is used on the client side:

* interacting with the DOM,
* and asynchronously getting or setting data on remote servers, often referred to as AJAX.

Note that AJAX technically uses XML as the data format, but we will be using JSON which is easier to parse, and becoming the defacto standard for much data on the web.

The principles of asynchronous communication and client side _callback functions_ are effectively identical for XML and JSON though.

## Task List

The tasks this week are split in to two "tracks" depending on your confidence with JS.

* Follow the "Basic" track if you are still building confidence with functions and objects.
* Follow the "Intermediate" track if you were able to complete most of the tasks on the previous weeks' worksheets (and wish to learn more advanced techniques for your Challenge assigments).

Aim to complete these in roughly 60-80 minutes of lab time.

**NOTE:** If you can't complete the tasks during the lab time, then commit your changes to your own fork of the 305CDE git repository (see [last week's worksheet](https://gitlab.com/c0lin/305cde/blob/master/labs/week3/worksheet3.md)) so that you can continue later. The techniques and knowledge developed this week will be very useful later. 

### _Basic_ Track

1. `events.html`
2. `map.html`
3. `JSON.html`
4. `ajax_basic.html`

### _Intermediate_ Track

1. `dom_scripting.html` and `js/dom_utils.js` or `js/dom_utils_global.js`
2. `ajax_sync.html` and `ajax_utils.js`
