# Modules

In this worksheet you will learning about the different types of modules that can be used to organise your code.

## ECMAScript 6 Modules

Until the release of ECMAScript 6 (Harmony) there was no native module support in JavaScript. In this task you will be learning how to write modules. Since this is cutting edge functionality you need to make sure you test using a supported browser. It is recommended you test using a recent version of Google Chrome.

**Note: as of the time of writing this worksheet modules are supported by all browsers with the exception of Internet Explorer and Edge**.
