# 305CDE Worksheet 1

## About

This week is mainly about getting started with JavaScript development. It will also cover some of the absolute basics of the language.

## Task List

Aim for around 5 minutes per task.

1. Register for a user account on [GitLab][]
2. Use Atlassian SourceTree to clone the 305CDE repository to your local machine / network drive
3. Create a new repository for your solution to the first weekly challenge
4. Clone it locally and test it works: modify, add, commit, push
5. Get the first JS example running in your browser and try to understand the code
6. Use the Chrome browser developer tools to fix bugs introduced in the second JS example
7. Use the Brackets JSLint feedback to improve the code in the third JS example 

## Steps Required

### Register for a user account on Gitlab

You will be using git version control for all of your code on this module. Register for a free account at [GitLab][]. This is an open source alternative to the more popular [GitHub][] which allows unlimited private repositories. Both of these are web front-ends for git repository management systems.

If you have never used git version control before, then read the quickstart [simple guide to git][]. You can then [become a git guru][]. 

### Use SourceTree to clone the 305CDE repository

Once you confirm your GitLab registration, you will be able to clone the 305CDE repository containing the materials for this module.

There are many git clients to choose from, and we will be using the Atlassian [SourceTree][] application in labs (Windows or OSX). If you are using Linux on your own computer, there are several ways to install a [command line client][git for linux] or a [gui client][git with gui].
