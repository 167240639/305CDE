# Simple API

You have already been introduced to NodeJS which allows for JavaScript to be run efficiently on a web server. In the exercises you interacted with the server through the Terminal window. In this worksheet you will be applying your existing skills to build an API that adheres to REST principles. By the end of the worksheet you will be in a position to start designing and building your own as part of your module assignment.

Before you start this or any other worksheet you should make sure you have the latest commits from the upstream repository on **GitHub**.
```
git pull upstream master
```
