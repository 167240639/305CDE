# Lab Worksheets

Welcome to the first topic. This is divided up into several worksheets and is aimed at getting you up to speed with the basic JavaScript programming language.

You will learn using an approach called the **cognitive apprenticeship**. This involves:

1. **Modelling**: you will see working code written by an expert which will allow you to understand the key concepts.
2. **Coaching**: you will use these concepts to carry out a number of structured activities under the guidance of experienced academics.
3. **Scaffolding**: you will learn the domain skills in a carefully determined sequence to maximise your subject understanding

## Graded Worksheets

The weekly worksheets have been carefully graded:

1. topics marked **01** are considered *core knowledge* and need to be understood if you are to pass the module.
2. topics marked **02** contain the intermediate skills and knowledge to boost your understanding and grade.
3. topics marked **03** are advanced and if you master these you will be able to push your grade even higher. You will be provided with a list of topics and some useful links, it is your responsibility to go away and find out about them before completing the worksheet.
