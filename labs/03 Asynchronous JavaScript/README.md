# Asynchronous Code

This weekâ€™s lab tasks will focus on how JavaScript is used to asynchronously get and set data on remote servers, often referred to as AJAX calls.

Note that AJAX technically uses XML as the data format, but we will be using JSON which is easier to parse, and becoming the defacto standard for much data on the web. The principles of asynchronous communication and callback functions are effectively identical for XML and JSON though.
