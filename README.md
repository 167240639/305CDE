### About

This repository contains lab code for weeks 1 to 5 of _305CDE Developing the Modern Web 2_ (full stack JavaScript with Node and Angular) at Coventry University.

### Weekly Schedule

1. JS development absolute basics
2. Objects and functions Part 1
3. Objects and functions Part 2
4. The DOM and AJAX
5. Using promises for clean asynchronous code

### Lab Format

Each 2 hour lab session will be divided into the following sequence of "mini sessions" of approximately 30 minutes each.

1. Completion/review of the previous weeks' programming challenge
	- you will receive formative feedback from your class tutors on what you have done / questions you have
	- save or commit each completed challenge for submission at the end of the term
2. Step-by-step worksheet introducing new code and concepts
3. Short slide session introducing new concepts/theory
	- used in the worksheet you just completed
	- needed to complete the next programming challenge
4. Programming challenge started (to be completed by next week)

## Week 1 - Basics

This week covers the basics of JS and how to get up and running with your development. Code is fairly minimal while you get up to speed.

## Week 2 - Objects and Functions Part 1

This week introduces the two key data types in JS: objects and functions. Get used to their basic syntax and common use cases.

## Week 3 - Objects and Functions Part 2

More advanced uses of objects and functions in JS.

Objects and functions are extremely powerful. This week explores some of the more advanced ways you can use both of them.

## Week 4 - The DOM and AJAX

Interacting with the browser, storing and manipulating JSON, and communicating with servers.

Once you are up to speed with the basics of JavaScript, you will want to begin using it to interact with _events_ and browser _documents_. Often this will involve storing or updating data in the browser or on a remote server.

## Week 5 - JavaScript Promises

Using JavaScript promises to build robust asynchronous code.
